CONCLUSION

There are two major findings in this analysis

    The drop in user engagement largely comes from existing-users (registered pre-May). We can see this trend through May to August. This should be reported to product management and marketing to see if anything could be done to reverse the trend.
    From July 31st to August 1, there appears to be a technical error that caused engagement to drop - more temporarily among new users, but more sustained among existing users. This is not surprising as the existing users are already engaging less, given the technical glitch, the chances of them returning is even less. It is important to report this to engineering to help identify the issue. We can look at their work log of what system changes had been made at the end of July.
