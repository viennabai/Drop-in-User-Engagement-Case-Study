# Drop-in-User-Engagement-Case-Study
My analysis of Mode's Case Study of a company's drop in user engagement data. SQL and Mode's report builder are used.

You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards. You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out:

Using 4 datasets provided by Mode, determine what caused the dip at the end of the chart shown above and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem.
